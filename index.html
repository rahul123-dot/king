  <p>The Great Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today,
    stories of his exploits are narrated as a part of the folklore.The Great Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had inspiring
    and endearing personality which spontaneously commanded respect, loyalty and the highest sacrifices from his devoted
    soldiers and peasants. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was also the staunch promoter of secularism and roused the
    sleeping conscience of the nation. He was the ultimate man of the father of freedom movement in Maharashtra and
    source of inspiration to the Hindu throughout India.</p><br>
  <p>Shivaji Bhosle was born on February 19, 1630 to Shahaji Bhosle and Jijabai in the fort of Shivneri, near the city
    of Junnar of the Pune district. Shivajiâ's father Shahaji was in service of the Bijapuri Sultanate - a tripartite
    association between Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golconda, as a general. He also owned a Jaigirdari near Pune. Shivaji's
    mother Jijabai was the daughter of Sindkhed leader Lakhujirao Jadhav and a deeply religious woman. Shivaji was
    especially close to his mother who instilled in him a strict sense of right and wrong. Since Shahaji spent most of
    his time outside of Pune, the responsibility of overseeing Shivajiâ's education rested on the shoulders of a small
    council of ministers which included a Peshwa (Shamrao Nilkanth),a Mazumdar (Balkrishna Pant), a Sabnis (Raghunath
    Ballal), a Dabir (Sonopant) and a chief teacher (Dadoji Konddeo). Kanhoji Jedhe and Baji Pasalkar were appointed to
    train Shivaji in military and martial arts. Shivaji was married to Saibai Nimbalkar in 1640. Shivaji Maharaj turned
    out to be a born leader from a very young age. By the age of 16, Shivaji Maharaj managed to gather a band of
    fiercely loyal Maratha men and set about conquering nearby lands. Their first triumph was the capture of Torna Fort
    of the Bijapur Kingdom. By 1647 he had captured Kondana and Rajgad forts and had control of much of the southern
    Pune region. In a bid to contain Shivaji, Adil Shah sent Afzal Khan, an experienced veteran general along with an
    army of 40,000 men to destroy Shivaji Maharaj. Afzal Khan tried to kill him in a private meeting, but Shivaji was on
    his guard. He killed Afzal Khan with his bakhna and destroyed Bijapur army. The King of Bijapur made peace with him.
    Shivajiâ's conflicts with the Bijapuri Sultanate and his continuous victories brought him under the radar of Mughal
    Emperor Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb saw him as a threat to expansion of his imperial intent and concentrated his efforts on
    eradicating the Maratha threat. Confrontations began in 1957, when Shivajiâ's generals raided and looted Mughal
    territories near Ahmednagar and Junnar. However, Aurangzebâ's retaliation was thwarted by arrival of rainy season
    and battle for succession back in Delhi. Aurangzeb directed Shaista Khan, Governor of Deccan and his maternal uncle,
    to subdue Shivaji. Shaista Khan launched a massive attack against Shivaji, capturing several forts under his control
    and even his capital Poona. Shivaji retaliated back by launching a stealth attack on Shaista Khan, eventually
    injuring him and evicting him from Poona. Shaista Khan later arranged multiple attacks on Shivaji, severely reducing
    his holds of forts in the Konkan region. To replenish his depleted treasury, Shivaji attacked Surat, an important
    Mughal trading center and looted the Mughal wealth. An infuriated Aurangzeb sent his chief general Jai Singh I with
    an army of 150,000. The Mughal forces made considerable dent, sieging forts under Shivajiâ's control, extracting
    money and slaughtering soldiers in their wake. Shivaji agreed to come to an agreement with Aurangzeb to prevent
    further loss of life and the Treaty of Purandar was signed between Shivaji and Jai Singh on June 11, 1665. Shivaji
    agreed to surrender 23 forts and pay a sum of 400000 as compensation to the Mughal Empire. Aurangzeb invited Shivaji
    to Agra with an aim to use his military prowess to consolidate Mughal empires in Afghanistan. Shivaji travelled to
    Agra with his eight year old son Sambhaji and was offended by Aurangzebâ's treatment of him. He stormed out of the
    court and an offended Aurangzeb placed him under house arrest. But Shivaji once again used his wit and cunning to
    escape the imprisonment. He feigned severe illness and arranged for baskets of sweets to be sent to temple as
    offerings for prayer. He disguised as one of the carriers and hid his son in one of the baskets, and escaped on
    August 17, 1666. In subsequent times, Mughal and Maratha hostilities were pacified to a large extent by constant
    mediation through Mughal Sardar Jaswant Singh. Peace lasted till 1670, after which Shivaji launched an all-out
    offense against the Mughals. He recovered most of his territories sieged by the Mughals within four months. Shivaji
    died at the age of 52 on April 3, 1680, at the Raigad Fort, after suffering from a bout of dysentery. A conflict of
    succession arose after his death between his eldest son Sambhaji and his third wife Soyrabai on behalf of her
    10-year old son Rajaram. Sambhaji dethroned the young Rajaram and ascended the throne himself on June 20, 1680.the
    Mughal-Maratha conflicts continued after Shivajiâ€™s death and the Maratha glory declined greatly. However it was
    reclaimed by young Madhavrao Peshwa who reclaimed Maratha glory and established his authority over North India.</p>

    </ul>
  </h2>
  <ol>
    <li> Find a proper mentor: Life lesson to learn from Shivaji Maharaj
      Shri. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had 3 mentors in his life. His mother, who taught him life lessons, which made
      him a Gentlemen. Dadoji Kondadev, who taught him all skills required for war like how to use weapons, etc. Ramdas
      Swami, who was a spiritual mentor to Shri. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

      This is the first lesson to learn from Shivaji Maharaj.

      Finding a proper mentor is like finding a diamond. Proper mentor will know you deeply and will help you to work on
      your weaknesses & foster strength. Right mentor will help you find proper strategy & will guide you to set &
      accomplish your goal.</li>
    <li>Respect every single woman: Societal lesson to learn from Shivaji Maharaj
      Once, one soldier from Shri. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s army brought the daughter in law of their rival after
      winning over them in a battle. He then introduce her to Shri. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. But what Shri.
      Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj did was worth remembering for ages. Instead of keeping that women in her cage, he asked
      for forgiveness on behalf of his soldier & gave her clothes & jewellery and sent her back to her troupe. Shri.
      Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj used to give death as punishment to the persons for harassing women.

      Nowadays, we see how women are insecure in this world. Women harassment is increasing day by day. It’s becoming a
      daily habit to watch or read somewhere about women harassment. This is really very shameful for all of us as a
      human being. It’s our responsibility to protect women. We consider women as Goddess, still some of us choose to
      harass them. Doesn’t it lower our own value?

      A nation’s greatness is measured by considering how the people treat every other being present over there. But
      unfortunately, people are harassing people, so treating other beings well is far away. We must take some
      considerations in our mind regarding women. We should respect them. To value women, our mentality should be
      changed. Because, after all it all depends on our mentality. We do what we think in our mind.

      Our mentality should be change then only we can respect women.</li>
    <li>Intelligence is greater than power:
      In every war, Shri. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had proved that intelligence is always few steps ahead of power.
      Shri. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had used intelligence prior, & more than power every time no matter whether it
      was war, agreement or politics.

      We must use our intelligence in doing anything. Intelligence starts its working too prior than the power does. It
      helps us achieve those things which are beyond our sight. Intelligence administrate the power. We cannot achieve
      any of our goal without intelligence. Even power games like wrestling, boxing needs intelligence to make
      strategies & planning.</li>
    <li>Respect every religion:
      Shri. Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj never did discrimination between castes, religion. He was against the caste
      system. He is well known for building Maratha Empire. It was greatest Hindu Empire. He build it to save Hindu
      religion from attacks of other Muslim empires. But he never hated Muslim religion. He neither hated any religion.
      He welcomed every religion in Maratha Empire. One Muslim was the leader of one of his arm force.

      What are we experiencing nowadays? It’s about religious war, caste discrimination, racism. The nation cannot be
      built if any one of these three problem is there. Nation needs peace, indiscrimination, and respect for all
      religion, all being in order to achieve happiness. The nation is not safe if any discrimination occurs. People
      must feel safe.

      Everyone loves their own religion, but that doesn’t mean one should hate other religion.

      Instead of hatred, we should foster “Unity in Diversity” culture.
